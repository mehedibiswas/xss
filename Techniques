1.First try to look where the input is reflected.Try to break the javascript with single quote,angle bracket,double quote etc and add just your payloads to execute.
2.If most of the payloads and attribute block by the developers than try to brute force the <tag> and attributes one by one to find which tag and attribute is not
blocked.
3.To execute javascript inside html attributes use "javascript:alert()" this payloads.
4.Try to encode the payloads to execute.
5.If special javascript character is automatically escaped,use escaped character "\" to escape the automatcally set escaped character.
6.Try to use custom-tag if regular tag is blocked.
7.Try to add attribute like mouse event(onclick,mouseup,mousedown),keyboard(accesskey), onload,onerror etc.


*** make sure the your payloads is url encoded if it pass into url.Tr
